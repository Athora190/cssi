<div>How to get there </div>
<p> During my travels to Canada, a person can get there by either train or airplane. I took both, I went to the country twice already the first time was by train and the second was by airplane. Both time I traveled there was very memorable and a wonderful experience that I will never forget.

<div>The Country itself </div>
<p> Canada is very beautiful with the Niagara Falls to the lushes green forests and countryside, both very different but a lovely experience. The food is no expectation. In Canada much like the clean side of New York has many places one could eat, for example I went to the forest cafe in the city, it was very lively and made me feel like I was the wild jungles with many different animals such as monkeys and tigers. </p>
